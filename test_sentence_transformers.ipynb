Nothing could exceed his energy when the working\\nfit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for\\ndays on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly\\nuttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night.

His very person and\\nappearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\\nobserver. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\\nlean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and\\npiercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have\\nalluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air\\nof alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and\\nsquareness which mark the man of determination.

Worn and exhausted, he\\nleaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent\\nwidespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that there\\nwere flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of\\nfestivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he\\nheard the clatter of horse’s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding\\ntowards him. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named\\nCowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. He\\ntherefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of\\nfinding out what Lucy Ferrier’s fate had been.\\n\\n“I am Jefferson Hope,” he said. “You remember me.”\\n\\nThe Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment—indeed, it was\\ndifficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly\\nwhite face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former\\ndays.

The hand of God is leading us under the person of our\\nProphet. You must come before him.

Here is a condensation of a few of them:—\\n\\nThe _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had\\nseldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German\\nname of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister\\ninscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political\\nrefugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in\\nAmerica, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten\\nlaws, and been tracked down by them.

They evidently\\nfailed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that\\nSherlock Holmes’ smallest actions were all directed towards some\\ndefinite and practical end.\\n\\n“What do you think of it, sir?” they both asked.\\n\\n“It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume\\nto help you,” remarked my friend. “You are doing so well now that it\\nwould be a pity for anyone to interfere.” There was a world of sarcasm\\nin his voice as he spoke. “If you will let me know how your\\ninvestigations go,” he continued, “I shall be happy to give you any\\nhelp I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who\\nfound the body. Can you give me his name and address?”\\n\\nLestrade glanced at his note-book. “John Rance,” he said. “He is off\\nduty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.”\\n\\nHolmes took a note of the address.\\n\\n“Come along, Doctor,” he said; “we shall go and look him up. I’ll tell\\nyou one thing which may help you in the case,” he continued, turning to\\nthe two detectives. “There has been murder done, and the murderer was a\\nman. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had\\nsmall feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a\\nTrichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,\\nwhich was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his\\noff fore leg.

Have you found it, Wiggins?”\\n\\n“No, sir, we hain’t,” said one of the youths.\\n\\n“I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do.

Good-bye.”\\n\\n“Good-bye,” I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably\\ninterested in my new acquaintance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\nTHE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.\\n\\n\\nWe met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No.\\n221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\\nconsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy\\nsitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\\nwindows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate\\ndid the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was\\nconcluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That\\nvery evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\\nfollowing morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and\\nportmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and\\nlaying out our property to the best advantage.

That trick of his of\\nbreaking in on his friends’ thoughts with an apropos remark after a\\nquarter of an hour’s silence is really very showy and superficial. He\\nhad some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a\\nphenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.”\\n\\n“Have you read Gaboriau’s works?” I asked. “Does Lecoq come up to your\\nidea of a detective?”\\n\\nSherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. “Lecoq was a miserable bungler,”\\nhe said, in an angry voice; “he had only one thing to recommend him,\\nand that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question\\nwas how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in\\ntwenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a\\ntext-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid.”\\n\\nI felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired\\ntreated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood\\nlooking out into the busy street. “This fellow may be very clever,” I\\nsaid to myself, “but he is certainly very conceited.”\\n\\n“There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,” he said,\\nquerulously. “What is the use of having brains in our profession. I\\nknow well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or\\nhas ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural\\ntalent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the\\nresult? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling\\nvillainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard\\nofficial can see through it.”\\n\\nI was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought\\nit best to change the topic.\\n\\n“I wonder what that fellow is looking for?” I asked, pointing to a\\nstalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the\\nother side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a\\nlarge blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a\\nmessage.\\n\\n“You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,” said Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n“Brag and bounce!” thought I to myself. “He knows that I cannot verify\\nhis guess.”\\n\\nThe thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were\\nwatching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across\\nthe roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps\\nascending the stair.\\n\\n“For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” he said, stepping into the room and handing\\nmy friend the letter.\\n\\nHere was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little\\nthought of this when he made that random shot. “May I ask, my lad,” I\\nsaid, in the blandest voice, “what your trade may be?”\\n\\n“Commissionaire, sir,” he said, gruffly. “Uniform away for repairs.”\\n\\n“And you were?” I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my\\ncompanion.\\n\\n“A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir.

When I returned with the\\npistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his\\nfavourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.\\n\\n“The plot thickens,” he said, as I entered; “I have just had an answer\\nto my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.”\\n\\n“And that is?” I asked eagerly.\\n\\n“My fiddle would be the better for new strings,” he remarked. “Put your\\npistol in your pocket.

Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still\\nand so lonesome, that I thought I’d be none the worse for some one with\\nme. I ain’t afeared of anything on this side o’ the grave; but I\\nthought that maybe it was him that died o’ the typhoid inspecting the\\ndrains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o’ turn, and I\\nwalked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher’s lantern, but\\nthere wasn’t no sign of him nor of anyone else.”\\n\\n“There was no one in the street?”\\n\\n“Not a livin’ soul, sir, nor as much as a dog.

Go on, though. What did you do next?”\\n\\nRance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified\\nexpression. “I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle.

He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin’ up agin the\\nrailings, and a-singin’ at the pitch o’ his lungs about Columbine’s\\nNew-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn’t stand, far less\\nhelp.”\\n\\n“What sort of a man was he?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\nJohn Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. “He\\nwas an uncommon drunk sort o’ man,” he said. “He’d ha’ found hisself in\\nthe station if we hadn’t been so took up.”\\n\\n“His face—his dress—didn’t you notice them?” Holmes broke in\\nimpatiently.\\n\\n“I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up—me\\nand Murcher between us.

Now we have the\\nSherlock Holmes’ test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.”\\n\\nHis eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\\nheart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\\nimagination.\\n\\n“You are to be congratulated,” I remarked, considerably surprised at\\nhis enthusiasm.\\n\\n“There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would\\ncertainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there\\nwas Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of\\nMontpellier, and Samson of New Orleans.

It’s just as well for two fellows to know the\\nworst of one another before they begin to live together.”\\n\\nI laughed at this cross-examination. “I keep a bull pup,” I said, “and\\nI object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all\\nsorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy.

His studies are\\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the\\nway knowledge which would astonish his professors.”\\n\\n“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\\n\\n“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\\n\\n“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits.

Don’t be mealy-mouthed\\nabout it.”\\n\\n“It is not easy to express the inexpressible,” he answered with a\\nlaugh. “Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes—it approaches\\nto cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch\\nof the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you\\nunderstand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an\\naccurate idea of the effects.
